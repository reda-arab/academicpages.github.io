I am a master's student in Mathematical Statistics at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/).  
I am graduated from [Ecole CentraleSupélec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentraleSup%C3%A9lec) [(Centrale Paris pathway)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Centrale_Paris) within [Paris-Saclay University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Saclay_University) [(see Shanghai Ranking in Mathematics)](http://www.shanghairanking.com/Shanghairanking-Subject-Rankings/mathematics.html) and before that, I completed two years of preparatory program (CPGE) at [Lycée Louis-le-Grand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Louis-le-Grand).

Mathpix Snipping Tool 
======
[Mathpix Snipping Tool](https://mathpix.com/) is a software that allows to take screenshots of Mathematics' formulas from PDFs or handwritten notes and obtain the corresponding LaTex formulas. 

I personnally use it to create my personal handouts from lecture notes (e.g. when you want to create a documents without proof or comment) and to avoid wasting time looking for the exact LaTex formulas I need to use. 

For my personal experience, it does not really work well with handwritten notes and you have to rewrite a large part of the content (I guess it largely depends on handwriting). But, if you have a lot of handwritten notes you want to type in LaTex, I think it will definitely make your life easier.  

Vim
======
I found this article ["How I'm able to take notes in mathematics lectures using LaTeX and Vim"](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) which explains a very interesting setup which allows to write LaTex very fast using Vim.

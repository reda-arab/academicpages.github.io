I believe that gathering information is important. I sometimes struggle to find important information as it is often scattered in different websites (e.g. on blogs, newspapers articles, university websites,  PDFs ,...).
In my opinion, it becomes important to create structures to gather important data, ressources in simple and efficient ways in order to access to information easily and quickly. It could be very interesting if people 
who knows which ressources are important in a field (e.g. experts, researchers) do it more often. 
The aim of this blog post is to try to apply this idea in practice for some fields. 

I will update this post or create a serie of posts in the future to add/update the ressources.


Machine Learning ressources
======
You can find [here](https://sgfin.github.io/learning-resources/?fbclid=IwAR1mdvyzKHj4Z1jvBKsZTzpZiDwDO8wRmAruv69p_1I223WizSuwqhVy9fE#causal) a blog post of Sam Finlayson who gathered a lot of ressources and published them online  


I want to add some other interesting ressources : 
- All courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) given by deeplearning.ai and Andrew Ng concerning Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
- The [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ) given at UCL by David Silver (DeepMind) on Reinforcement Learning available on Youtube.
- Ressources on [Qingyuan Zhao's website](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/teaching/causal-2020/) on Causal Inference
- [Kaggle courses and competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/) in order to put into practice theories (ML, DL, NLP,...)
- For French readers : un [lexique utile](http://variances.eu/?p=5212&fbclid=IwAR3iBy6FM3TDI4m_0BJyyp3iDZ8xrqXXtQ3otVSz44RdDBMqXI-vMl3seAI ) pour le jargon du ML 

PhD ressources 
======
An [interesting blog post](https://gdalle.github.io/PhDResources/) published by Guillaume Dalle on useful ressources for PhD students
